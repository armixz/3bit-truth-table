# Verilog 3 bit truth table

---

- Modules
  - AND 
  - OR 
  - XOR 
  - NOT 
  - NAND 
  - NOR 
  - XNOR
  - F1, F2(custom function)

## Using a Hardware Design Language, write a program that create a truth table, that shows a row (min term) number, the 4 input bits N,G,S,  and the results of the following nine equations as follow:

- Create a module based on the equation (N'G')'(N'S')'(G'S')'
- Create a module based on the equation (NG+NS+GS)
- Create a module to show a three-bit AND gate.
- Create a module to show a three -bit OR gate.
- Create a module to show a three -bit XOR gate.
- Create a module to show a three -bit NOT gate.
- Create a module to show a three -bit NAND gate.
- Create a module to show a three -bit NOR gate.
- Create a module to show a three -bit XNOR gate.
